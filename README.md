# VirusTotal-File-Scan-Bot
Preface: Telegram is a popular social media app with rich features such as the existence of bots, generous file sharing limitations, and the group chats and channels which allows for individuals to share content to a large audience. 

With great power comes great responsibility. With this app being used to share files easily with a large audience, this means has created an easy way for malware to be shared across a wide audience. 

Malware poses a large threat to the digital community and it's deceitful nature could negatively impact an individual's career.

I originally designed this bot for Telegram users to make proper judgement when downloading documents from unknown sources. VirusTotal, an Alphabet service, provides cloud malware scanning to users free of charge, for second judgement whether a file is safe to use. 

While bringing this project into fruition, it has encouraged me to research the kinds of malware floating on social media and how the development of malware has changed since the introduction of social media.
